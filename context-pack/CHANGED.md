Verification:
- Build, migrate, start. Run `/holdem create` then verify the embed shows blinds and buy-in range.
- `/holdem join table:<id> buyin:<min..max>` succeeds; `/holdem status` shows your seat and stack.

2025-10-10 ‚Äî Admin commands: fixes, prettification, and reboot improvements
- Fixed `/admin add` to properly use User option (type 6); removed fallback string parsing
- Replaced all deprecated `ephemeral: true` with `MessageFlags.Ephemeral` throughout admin commands

2025-10-09 ‚Äî Command diagnostics and dedupe
- Added /admin appinfo, /admin list-commands, /admin force-purge
- Registrar now warns if token‚Äôs application id != APP_ID
- Command builders are deduped by name before global registration

### Testing
1) Build the bot
2) Run /admin sync-commands in a guild; expect global sync and guild purge summary
3) Verify commands work globally without guild-scoped duplicates

2025-10-09 ‚Äî /admin list now lists NORMAL admins
Primary list now comes from guild_admins (per guild)

Super admin is shown as a header line only

Compatible with legacy timestamps via COALESCE(created_at, added_at)

Empty-state copy clarified

2025-10-09 ‚Äî Admin hardening + Roulette moves to KV with legacy fallback
/admin add validates Discord IDs/mentions; adaptive insert handles added_at and legacy created_at with NOT NULL

/admin list selects COALESCE(created_at, added_at) and orders by the same

/admin sync-commands now replies cleanly when APP_ID/CLIENT_ID is missing

Roulette reads limits from guild_settings keys (roulette.*) with sane defaults, falling back to legacy table if present

Verified flows in dev-only mode: admin add/list/sync and roulette bets behave without schema errors

## 2025-10-09 ‚Äî Dev-only gate supports multiple roles
Added RG_DEVONLY_ROLES (comma-separated) and defaulted to 1425816468041236521,142585311451451582

Runtime exposes devOnlyRoles: Set<string>; middleware checks ‚Äúany-of‚Äù

- /admin list now selects COALESCE(created_at, added_at) AS created_at and orders by the same
- Compatible with legacy and modern super_admins shapes
- Verified in dev-only mode: list renders without SQL errors

## 2025-10-09 ‚Äî Adaptive super-admin insert respects NOT NULL created_at
- Admin schema now reported via PRAGMA; insertion populates all required timestamp columns
- If created_at exists and is NOT NULL, insert sets it alongside added_at
- Prevents NOT NULL failures on legacy admin DBs without altering table defaults
- Verified migrate:guilds succeeds on legacy and fresh DBs

## 2025-10-09 ‚Äî Handlers aligned to KV settings; admin timestamp compatibility
- Moved handlers to key/value `guild_settings` via helpers (`getSetting`/`setSetting`)
- `/theme` uses UPSERT; no direct column writes
- `super_admins` reads use `COALESCE(created_at, added_at)`; inserts write `added_at`
- Added optional `v_guild_settings` view for convenience
- Verified `/ping`, `/theme set`, `/admin list`, `/daily` on fresh and existing guild DBs

## 2025-10-09 ‚Äî Fix migration order: tables before indices; idempotent indexes
- Added 000a_create_balances.sql to create required tables before index migrations
- 001_add_indices.sql now uses CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS
- 002_add_cooldowns.sql ensures table exists before indexing
- Verified migrate:guilds succeeds on fresh and existing guild DBs

## 2025-10-09 ‚Äî SQLite migrations: strip nested transactions; SAVEPOINT wrapper; correct schema check
- Runner now strips BEGIN/COMMIT from migration files and wraps each file in a SAVEPOINT
- _migrations considered valid when columns are exactly {name, applied_at}; legacy shapes are rebuilt online
- Standardized _migrations to (name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, applied_at INTEGER NOT NULL)
- Removed ORDER BY id anywhere in migrator
- Updated 000_core.sql to be non-transactional; atomicity is handled by the runner

## 2025-10-09 ‚Äî Fix _migrations schema; make migrator schema-agnostic
- Updated _migrations to minimal schema (name PRIMARY KEY, applied_at); rebuild wrong schemas online
- migrateGuildDb now checks and rebuilds _migrations if malformed
- Removed ORDER BY id; queries only name

## 2025-10-09 ‚Äî Harden per-guild migrations; bootstrap `_migrations`; migrate-on-open; router retry
- Added `000_core.sql` creating `_migrations`, `guild_settings`, and `guild_admins`
- `migrateGuildDb` now bootstraps `_migrations` and applies pending files atomically per DB
- Every guild DB migrates immediately upon open; added startup sweep over `data/guilds/*.db`
- Router retries once after a missing-table error, then fails with `ERR-DB-SCHEMA` and logs detail
- Migrate CLI now uses console-backed logger to avoid pino/sonic-boom flush races

## 2025-10-09 ‚Äî Bootstrap `_migrations` + core guild schema; migrate-on-open; router retry
- Added `000_core.sql` to create `_migrations`, `guild_settings`, and `guild_admins`
- Per-guild migrator now creates `_migrations` if missing and applies pending files atomically
- Run migrations immediately after opening each `data/guilds/{guildId}.db` and via a startup sweep
- Router retries once on "no such table", then fails gracefully with ERR-DB-SCHEMA
- Verified on guild 1414225727179591712: commands execute after bootstrap

## 2025-10-09 ‚Äî Per-guild migrate-on-open + core schema + router retry
- Added guild core migration (000_core.sql) creating guild_settings and guild_admins
- Now run per-guild migrations immediately after opening each data/guilds/{guildId}.db
- Added startup sweep over data/guilds/*.db
- Router retries once on "no such table", then fails gracefully with ERR-DB-SCHEMA
- Verified on guild 1414225727179591712: /ping, /admin list, /theme set succeed after bootstrap

### Changes Made
- NEW: src/db/migrations/guild/000_core.sql with core guild schema
- MOD: src/db/migrate.ts to implement migrateGuildDb with _migrations bookkeeping and idempotent runner
- MOD: src/db/connection.ts to call migrateGuildDb after DB open
- MOD: src/index.ts to add startup sweep over data/guilds/*.db before client login
- MOD: src/interactions/router.ts to retry once on "no such table" errors, then fail gracefully
- MOD: package.json to add "migrate:guilds" script

### Testing
1) Build and sweep:
   npm run build
   npm run migrate:guilds
2) Start the bot, then in the problem guild run:
   /ping
   /admin list
   /theme set theme: cherry
   Expect no "no such table" errors; first run may log migrate_guild applies.
3) Kill and restart; migrations should log no new applies; commands should still work.
2025-10-10 ‚Äî Remove Exact/Copy buttons; Blackjack Play Again ‚Üí new message
- Economy cards now show pretty value plus secondary `exact: 1,234,567` line. Buttons removed.
- Eliminated InteractionAlreadyReplied by using defer+editReply across econ commands.
- Blackjack ‚ÄúPlay Again‚Äù now acknowledges the button and posts a new message with a fresh hand; only original player can use it.

- `/admin list` now renders the badge-styled card (Super Admin + Current Admins) and is visible to everyone (non-ephemeral).
- Mentions use `<@id>`; dates show as YYYY-MM-DD; avoids duplicate replies via defer+editReply.

2025-10-10 ‚Äî `/loan apply`
- Added `/loan apply amount:<int> apr:<bps> term_days:<int>` which validates against user-specific offers, creates the loan, credits the wallet, and returns a confirmation card with quick-pay buttons.
